            //all objects from a class will have same number and type of states, BUT ...
            //each instance can have its own unique values.

            //the format we use to instantiate an object looks like this:
            //ClassName objectName = new className();
            Cat mittens = new Cat();
            //to create a new object. we use a special method called a CONSTRUCTOR

            //thinking aboout objects in real life, create (either hand write or type)
            //three examples of objects. your objects should have five states(characteristics)
            //and five behaviors
        }
